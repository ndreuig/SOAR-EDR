## Introduction

### What is edr?
EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) is a cybersecurity technology that detects, investigates, and responds to advanced threats on endpoint devices like laptops, desktops, and servers. It provides real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response capabilities to help protect against cyber attacks.

### What is SOAR?
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is a cybersecurity technology that automates and streamlines security incident response processes. It integrates with various security tools to provide a centralized platform for threat detection, incident response, and remediation, helping to improve efficiency and reduce response times.

### Project Overview
â€¦..
### Workflow

### Project Environment

A hands-on cybersecurity automation project utilizing Kali Linux as the primary operating system, VirtualBox for virtualization, LimaCharlie as the endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform, Tines for security orchestration, Slack for communication, and LaZagne as a simulated password recovery tool to demonstrate and test a comprehensive security detection and response workflow.

   - Provides real-time monitoring and detection capabilities
   - Enables custom rule creation and automated response mechanisms
   - Serves as the primary threat detection tool in the project

**Tines**
   - Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform
   - Allows creation of complex workflow automation
   - Enables integration between different security tools
   - Used to design and implement automated incident response workflows

**Slack**
   - Communication platform for notifications and alerts
   - Integrated into the incident response workflow
   - Provides real-time messaging and collaboration capabilities
   - Used to send automated notifications about detected events

**LaZagne**
   - Open-source password recovery tool
   - Used as a simulated malware/testing tool
   - Helps demonstrate detection capabilities
   - Provides a realistic scenario for testing the security workflow

![Table 2](./screenshots/screenshot9.png)

**Configuring the Detect Descriptor**

In the Detect Descriptor, enter the following configuration:
```bash
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: is
    name: linux
  - op: or
    rules:
      - case sensitive: false
        op: ends with
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: python3.12
      - case sensitive: false
        op: ends with
        path: event/COMMAND_LINE
        value: all
      - case sensitive: false
        op: contains
        path: event/COMMAND_LINE
        value: lazagne
      - case sensitive: false
        op: is
        path: event/HASH
        value: "bbe76b860d1abdb0e1146cb2be037ba63cbf430d87af42e89de33bd46222764b"
```
**In plain english** 
The even must be a (NEW_PROCESS AND must be a linux) AND file_path ends with python3.12 OR command_line ends with all OR command_line contains lazagne
OR hash == Lazagne hash.

**Configuration Explanation**

The Detect Descriptor configuration is designed to detect a specific type of malicious activity. The configuration is based on the analysis of a real-world event, as shown in the following JSON data:
```bash
{
  "event": {
    "COMMAND_LINE": "python3 laZagne.py all",
    "FILE_PATH": "/usr/bin/python3.12",
    "HASH": "bbe76b860d1abdb0e1146cb2be037ba63cbf430d87af42e89de33bd46222764b",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
The following conditions were chosen for the Detect Descriptor configuration:

1. NEW_PROCESS: We chose to focus on NEW_PROCESS events because when we run the Lazagne tool with the "all" argument, it creates a new process that can be detected in our organization's timeline. Specifically, we can see this event by navigating to our organization, then sensors, then sensors list, then choosing our machine, then scrolling to the timeline on the left navigation, and searching for "lazagne" in the search bar.

2. linux: We chose to focus on Linux-based systems because our project is based on a Kali Linux virtual machine.

3. python3.12: The FILE_PATH field contains "/usr/bin/python3.12", which indicates that the process was executed using Python 3.12.

4. all: The COMMAND_LINE field contains "python3 laZagne.py all", which suggests that the process was executed with the "all" argument.

5. lazagne: The COMMAND_LINE field contains "laZagne.py", which is a clear indication that the Lazagne tool was used.

6. hash: The HASH field contains "bbe76b860d1abdb0e1146cb2be037ba63cbf430d87af42e89de33bd46222764b", which is the hash of the Lazagne tool.

**Configuring the Respond Descriptor**

In the Respond Descriptor, enter the following configuration:
```bash
- action: report
  metadata:
    author: IN
    description: Detects LaZagne (SOAR-EDR Tool)
  falsepositives:
    - Unlikely
  level: medium
  tags:
    - attack.credential_access
  name: IN - HackTool - LaZAgne (SOAR-EDR)
```

### Incident Message Details Template

To extract the required information from the webhook event, follow these steps:

**Method 1: Manual Copying**

1. Click on the webhook and then click on events. If you don't have an event yet, head back to your virtual machine and execute LaZagne in your terminal (assuming you have connected Tines with LimaCharlie).
2. Once you have an event, select it and expand the "retrieve_detection" section in the center of the page.
3. Expand "body", then "detect", and then both "event" and "routing".
4. Copy the following fields:
	* "cat" and "link" from the main section
	* "COMMAND_LINE", "USER_NAME", and "FILE_PATH" from the "event" section
	* "hostname", "event_time", "int_ip", and "sid" from the "routing" section

**Method 2: Using Tines' Slack Integration**

1. Click on Slack in your Story and go to the Build tab.
2. Click on the Message field to activate it, and then click the plus button that appears.
3. Select "Value" from the options.
4. In the Data section, click on "retrieve_detections" and then "body".
5. Click on "body" again to see the available fields.
6. Select the required fields, such as "cat" (title), without clicking on it again to avoid adding a dot.

**Formatting the Data**

Once you have copied the required fields, paste them into a notepad and format the data to make it more user-friendly. You can add labels such as "Title:", "Time:", "Computer:", etc.

For the email, use HTML to create line breaks by wrapping each field in a `<br>` tag.

**Example Output**

Here's an example of how you can format the data:

Tittle: <<retrieve_detections.body.cat>>
Time: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.routing.event_time>>
Computer: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.routing.hostname>>
Source IP: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.routing.int_ip>>
Username: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.event.USER_NAME>>
FIle Path: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.event.FILE_PATH>>
Command Line: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.event.COMMAND_LINE>>
Sensor ID: <<retrieve_detections.body.detect.routing.sid>>
Detection Link: <<retrieve_detections.body.link>>

You can paste this formatted data into the contents section under the title in your User Prompt page.
